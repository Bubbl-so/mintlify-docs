1. **Open your New Organization**

   From your profile, click on the New Organization.
2. **Manage Organization**

   Once opened, click on 'Manage Organization' button.
3. **Complete Onboarding Setup Guide**

   Complete your profile: To help attendees discover and trust your brand, make sure your public organizer profile is fully customized.

   Note: You can add Instagram, Description, Background Image, Contact Methods, and more\!
4. **Connect your bank**

   To sell **paid tickets** on Bubbl, you must connect your organization to a verified **Stripe account**.

   Why This Matters

   Bubbl uses Stripe to securely process payments and send payouts directly to your bank. Without this step, you can still create free events—but you won’t be able to publish or sell tickets for paid ones.

   What You Need to Know:
   - **Bank Account Location**:\
     Your connected bank must be located in the **same country where your organization is legally registered**.
   - **Legal Verification**:\
     Stripe may require supporting documents to verify your identity or business (e.g., government-issued ID, tax ID, or business registration).
   - **One-Time Setup**:\
     You only need to complete this once per organization. Once connected, all payouts for future events will go directly to your linked account.
5. **Add Admins**

   Add the rest of your team to the admin list. They must have a Bubbl account for you to add them.
