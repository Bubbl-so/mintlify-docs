# Understanding Disputes

Disputes are a normal part of online payments — they happen when a guest contacts their bank to question a charge.\
At Bubbl, we do everything possible to **prevent disputes before they even start**, through best practices across our payment flow: clear statement descriptors, transparent non-refundable terms, and verified ticket scan data.\
As a result, disputes are rare — and when they do happen, **you stay in control, and we handle the heavy lifting for you.**

<Info>
  **Our goal:** make disputes rare, easy, and fair — so you can focus on your events while Bubbl manages the technical side with Stripe.

## Overview

A **dispute** (also called a **chargeback**) occurs when a guest’s bank temporarily reverses a charge while reviewing the transaction. This is standard in online payments and affects every platform that uses cards.

Common reasons include:

- The attendee doesn’t recognize the charge.
- The card was used without authorization.
- The event was canceled or not as described.
- The attendee went to their bank instead of contacting support.

When a dispute is filed, the funds are temporarily pulled back by the bank until a decision is made.

## How Bubbl Helps

Bubbl gives you **full visibility and control** over all disputes, while handling the complex parts with Stripe.

- **Automatic alerts:** You’ll be notified whenever a dispute is opened.
- **Dashboard tracking:** View all open and past disputes from your **Finance** page.
- **Evidence handling:** If you choose to contest a dispute, Bubbl prepares and submits all supporting evidence — receipts, payment data, ticket scans, and proof of entry — directly to Stripe.
- **Guidance:** We can help you decide whether to fight or accept based on Stripe’s estimated win-likelihood, dispute reason, and the associated fee.

<Info>
  **You decide whether to fight.**\
  Once you choose to contest, Bubbl handles the submission process fully for you.

## Fees & Outcomes

**Dispute Fee:** Stripe charges a **\$15 dispute fee for every dispute created**, regardless of the outcome.

**Fighting Fee:** Stripe also charges a **\$15 fighting fee** if you choose to contest (fight) the dispute. This fee is refunded if the dispute if fought and won.

### Possible Outcomes

- **Won:**\
  The bank rules in your favor. The funds are returned automatically, and Bubbl reimburses the \$15 fighting fee.
- **Lost:**\
  The bank sides with the attendee. The disputed amount and \$15 fee are deducted from your Bubbl balance (or linked payout method if the balance is insufficient).
- **Accepted:**\
  If you choose not to fight, the customer’s refund becomes permanent and no further action is needed.

<Info>
  **Tip:** We’re happy to advise on when it makes sense to fight — often based on event attendance, scan proof, and likelihood of success.

## Regional Handling

### **US Organizers**

- Stripe **automatically** adjusts your Bubbl balance when a dispute is won or lost.
- Funds from successful disputes return automatically.

### **International Organizers**

- Stripe does not yet support automatic deductions for non-US accounts.
- Bubbl manages this manually through one of two methods:
  1. **Invoice:** Issued for any lost disputes, payable within 7 days.
  2. **Card on File:** Automatically charged at the end of the month.

<Info>
  **Important:** Unpaid invoices may temporarily pause payouts until resolved.

1. Keep event info, refund, and cancellation policies clear.
2. Respond quickly when attendees reach out.
4. Communicate any major event changes clearly.

<Info>
