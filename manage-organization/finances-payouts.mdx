### What Is the Finances Page?

The **Finances page** gives you a real-time overview of your community’s financial status — including available balances, payout activity, and recent Stripe transactions.

This is also where you **connect your Bubbl account to your bank** via **Stripe Connect**, enabling secure and automated payouts.

### Where to Find It

- **Web:** Go to **Manage Organization \> Finance \> Payouts** on your organization dashboard
- **App:** Go to **Manage Organization \> Finances & Payouts **page

### What You’ll See

#### Balances:

- **Total Revenue:** All revenue earned (including pending amounts)
- **Available to Payout:** Amount ready to be transferred to your bank
- **Available Soon:** Funds processing and becoming available
- **In Transit to Bank:** Funds already on their way to your account

> Balances update in real time and may take 3-5 business days after each transaction to become available.

<Info>
  If you see an alert saying: Complete the required information in Stripe or your account may be disabled, open your stripe dashboard. If not resolved contact support@usebubbl.app

- **Bank Name:** Where payouts are deposited
- **Account Number:** Masked for security

You can view all recent payouts, sorted by most recent at the top.
