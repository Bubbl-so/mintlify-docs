- Add **pre-approval** and **application questions** for exclusivity.
- Gate specific events, chats, or community perks to members.

### For Wellness or Fitness Communities

Simplify your subscription model:

- Offer **weekly passes** or **monthly recurring memberships**.
- Use **member-only event tiers** for classes or retreats.

4. **Loyalty ecosystem:** turn event buyers into recurring paying members.
5. **Community data:** track engagement, renewals, and churn directly in Bubbl analytics.
