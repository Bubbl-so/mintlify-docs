## What You Can Do With Memberships

**Unlock recurring revenue, exclusivity, and loyalty**

Organizers can now create free and paid memberships for their communities. Offer perks, monetize loyalty, and gate experiences, all natively within Bubbl. Whether you’re running a nightlife brand, a private club, or a wellness collective, memberships give you a simple way to create recurring value, strengthen your brand, and build a direct relationship with your most engaged audience.

Bubbl memberships are more than subscriptions they’re your new operating layer:

## Why Use Memberships

### For Nightlife Brands

Turn your followers into a private guestlist:

- Offer **priority entry**, **discounted tickets**, or **exclusive tables**.
- Reward loyalty, members always get access first.
- Partner with venues or sponsors: “Members drink free until midnight,” “Members get 10% off bottles.”

### For Private / Social Clubs

Build your own recurring ecosystem:

- Offer **monthly dues** or **tiered memberships** (Gold, Platinum, etc.).
- Add **pre-approval** and **application questions** for exclusivity.
- Gate specific events, chats, or community perks to members.

### For Wellness or Fitness Communities

Simplify your subscription model:

- Offer **weekly passes** or **monthly recurring memberships**.
- Use **member-only event tiers** for classes or retreats.
- Combine with sponsors: “Members get free samples from X brand.”

### For Creators & Collectives

Turn your following into a paid community:

## How This Unlocks New Revenue Streams

Memberships let you diversify beyond ticketing:

1. **Recurring income:** predictable monthly revenue independent of events.
2. **Member-only events:** sell higher-tier access or bundles for loyal customers.
3. **Sponsorship leverage:** offer brands guaranteed visibility across your recurring member base.
4. **Loyalty ecosystem:** turn event buyers into recurring paying members.
5. **Community data:** track engagement, renewals, and churn directly in Bubbl analytics.

Organizers who combine **memberships + events** see**higher retention**  and **more predictable monthly revenue.**
