## How This Unlocks New Revenue Streams

Memberships let you diversify beyond ticketing:

1. **Recurring income:** predictable monthly revenue independent of events.
2. **Member-only events:** sell higher-tier access or bundles for loyal customers.
3. **Sponsorship leverage:** offer brands guaranteed visibility across your recurring member base.
4. **Loyalty ecosystem:** turn event buyers into recurring paying members.
5. **Community data:** track engagement, renewals, and churn directly in Bubbl analytics.

Organizers who combine **memberships + events** see**higher retention**  and **more predictable monthly revenue.**
