You can accept contactless card payments directly from your phone at the door — no additional hardware needed. It’s ideal for charging **custom amounts** or selling **specific ticket tiers** in person.

**How to use it:**

1. **Enable it** from **Manage Organizations**.
   - Tap to Pay  \>  Enable
   - Just set it up once to use in any event.
2. **Start using** it within the **Event Scanner**.
   - A new tab will appear left of the scan view.
   - Enable Location services with Always Allow.
   - All iOS scanners will be able to charge at the door.

<Info>
  We recommend setting this up at least a day before an event. As Stripe may require more information after enabling the service.
