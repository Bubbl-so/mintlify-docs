    ## What notifications do users receive?

    As a user, Bubbl keeps you in the loop with personalized, real-time updates that help you stay connected with your favorite events and communities.

    ### You will receive a notification when: 

    - A new event is posted by a community you follow
    - A friend RSVPs or purchases a ticket
    - An event you have purchased tickets is starting soon
    - An organizer sends a chat for an event you have purchased tickets to
    - A gallery is posted from an event you purchased tickets to
    - Someone requests to follow you
    - You receive a DM from another user

    These notifications are designed to help you discover new events, plan better, and stay socially connected.

    ### What is Ghost Mode?

    **Ghost Mode** lets you use Bubbl without triggering friend-to-friend purchase notifications.

    When it's turned on:

    - Friends won’t see alerts about your activity

    To turn off any other type of notifications, you can turn off all notifications from your Ios Settings App

    ## Tips:

    - **Follow your favorite communities**\
      That way, you’ll never miss a drop or event announcement. You will also get access to tickets as soon as the event is published.
    - **Enable push notifications**\
      Stay in the loop when friends buy tickets or events are about to start.
    - **Invite and add your friends**\
      Going to events with friends is easier, when everyone joins early.
    - **Use Ghost Mode if needed**\
      Want to go lowkey? Turn on Ghost Mode to hide your activity from friends.
    - **Engage with Organizers**\
      Have questions? Send them a dm to ask questions, get updates, or even get table reservations. 
    - **Check out galleries**\
      Relive the moment and discover new communities through post-event content.

    ## What notifications do community admins receive?

    Admins and cohosts get real-time notifications to stay informed, manage their events, and boost engagement:

    ### Sales and Orders:

    - **You just sold a ticket\!** — Get notified when someone buys (or RSVPs to) your event
    - **New order pending approval** — For RSVP-approval events, get notified when a user requests tickets

    #### Event Management

    - **New cohost added** — When you or someone else assigns a new cohost
    - **New scanner added** — Get notified when someone is granted scanner access
    - **You are now a cohost/scanner** — When you’re added to an event team

    #### Community Growth

    - **New event notification** — When you create a new public event, all your followers (and cohost followers) are notified

    #### Guest Interaction

    - **New chat in event** — If you post in the event group chat, interested users get notified
    - **New direct message** — When someone sends you a DM
    - **Friend purchased a ticket** — If a friend buys tickets, their friends are notified (helps your event grow organically)

    ## Tips to Succeed: 

    - **Grow your followers early**\
      The more people follow your community, the more reach your events will have through push notifications and in-app discovery.
    - **Encourage people to download the app**

      Use App Exclusive ticket sales to encourage people to download the app, this will help your future sales thanks to the notifications Bubbl sends. 
    - **Use eye-catching event covers**\
      Great visuals drive clicks. Invest in high-quality graphics to stand out in the feed.
    - **Send notifications strategically**\
      Announce events, at the right times, since all your followers will receive a notification that a new event was posted.
    - **Add post-event galleries**\
      Post photos after events to boost retention and build your brand’s vibe over time. You can also send a notification to all event purchases when the gallery is posted.
