### Can I use my ticket from my phone?

Yes. Just show your QR code at the door.

### What if I didn’t get my ticket?

First, check **"My Tickets"** in your Bubbl profile. If your ticket doesn’t appear:

- Make sure you're logged in with the **same phone number** you used at purchase
- If it was a **gift**, check your notifications or messages for the transfer
- Check your **email** that you used to purchase the ticket, look into spam.
- Still can’t find it? Email us at [**support@usebubbl.app**](mailto:support@usebubbl.app) with the event name and your info you used to purchase the ticket

### What happens if my ticket is pending approval?

Some events require organizer approval before confirming your order. If your request is pending:

- You’ll see a **"Waiting for approval"** status in My Tickets
- If approved, the ticket will become active and scannable
- If declined, any temporary charge will be removed automatically (can take up to **10 business days**)
