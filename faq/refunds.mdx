    #### Can I get a refund on my ticket?

    Refunds are only issued if the event is **officially canceled**. In that case, you will receive a **full refund** to your original payment method within **5–10 business days**.

    For all other cases (personal reasons, no-shows, entry issues, etc.), refunds are **at the sole discretion of the event organizer**. If the organizer chooses to refund you, **Bubbl’s service fees remain non-refundable**.

    > To request a refund directly, you can message the organizer through the event page in the Bubbl app.

    #### What happens if my request to buy a ticket (RSVP approval) is declined?

    Some events require approval before confirming your ticket. If your request is **declined**, your card will **not be charged**.

    - Any temporary charge or authorization on your card will be **automatically canceled**
    - Depending on your bank, the funds may take up to **10 business days** to reappear in your account

    > Bubbl does not control how quickly your bank releases the funds. If it takes longer, we recommend contacting your bank directly.

    ### How do refunds work on Bubbl?

    As the organizer, **you are in full control** of refunds. Bubbl **will never issue a refund without your approval**, unless the event is officially canceled through the platform.

    ### Can I issue a refund to a buyer?

    Yes. You can initiate a refund directly from your **Manage Event \> Orders** tab. Refunds are processed back to the original payment method.

    > Note: Bubbl’s platform fees are **non-refundable**, even if the ticket is refunded.
    >
    > Tip: Issuing a refund is often less expensive than disputing a chargeback. Stripe may charge dispute fees and side with the customer unless strong evidence is provided.

    #### What if I cancel my event?

    In this case please reach out to [**support@usebubbl.app**](mailto:support@usebubbl.app)** **within **24 hours** so we can process the event cancellation and refund all tickets.
