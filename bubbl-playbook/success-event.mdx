---

## BEFORE THE EVENT

### 1. **Optimize Your Event and Community Page**

- Use a **high-quality cover image** — vibrant, on-brand, and recognizable.
- **Title matters**: Keep it short, clear, and searchable.
- Add a **detailed but skimmable description**: include location details, age restrictions, dress code, time, and refund policy.
- Use the **Event Gallery** feature to add behind-the-scenes or past event photos — this builds trust and hype.

### 2. **Enable Smart Ticketing**

- Offer **tiers or phases**: Early Bird, General Admission, and Last-Minute. Reward your early buyers.
- Set **ticket limits and price jumps** to create urgency.
- Add \*\*tables \*\*for vip guests.
- **(USA ONLY)** Enable **tap-to-pay at the door** for seamless entry and last-minute buyers.

### 3. **Activate Social Features**

- Encourage attendees to **follow your community** — they’ll get alerts when new events go live.
- Make sure your event is **attached to your organizer profile/community**, not created standalone.

### 4. **Promote the Right Way**

- Share your event link. **Everywhere**. Use **Tracking Links** to understand where your traffic is coming from.
- Add **Promoters **to your event. Give them their permissions and they will be able to share their link.
- **Leverage followers**: Every person who purchases **via the app**  sends a **notification** to all their friends that they are attending your event.

## DURING THE EVENT

### 1. **Streamline Check-In**

- Use the **Bubbl Scanner App** (iOS & Android) — lightning-fast and supports multiple check-in devices.
- **No QR? No problem** — search by name, email, or phone.
- Enable **tap-to-pay at the door** to boost walk-in sales and cut lines.
- Have someone monitor the **"Tickets" tab** in case of any guest issues.

### 2. **Engage On-Site**

- Take **high-quality photos and videos** during the event — they’ll be useful for the post-event gallery.
- **_Have an amazing time\!_**

## AFTER THE EVENT

### 1. **Leverage the Social Feed**

- Upload a **photo gallery** to the event — guests will return to view and share it.
- Send a **"Gallery is Live" push notification** to attendees to engage with them.
- Reward top promoters, shoutouts or ticket discounts.

### 2. **Analyze & Improve**

- Review the **Overview dashboard**: track ticket sales by time, channel, promoter, or source.
- Use data to adjust for your next event: best-selling ticket type, top traffic sources, biggest drop-off points.
- Identify your **most engaged buyers** — and consider messaging them directly (via DMs or socials) for future VIP invites.

### 3. **Grow Your Following**

- Check how many **followers you gained** from this event — this is your long-term asset.
- Plan the next drop within a week — don’t let your hype die down.
- Stay consistent: every event builds your brand and your following.

## Bonus Tips

- **Promoter links** = free sales army. Use them early, track performance, reward top performers.
- Make your **event titles consistent** (e.g., “Midnight Affair Vol. 1”, “Vol. 2”...) to build brand equity.
- Don’t delete events — let people browse past galleries, follow your evolution, and build trust.
