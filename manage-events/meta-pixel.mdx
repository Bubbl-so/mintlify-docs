## What is Meta Pixel and Why It Matters?

The **Meta Pixel** is a tool from Meta that tracks what people do on your **Bubbl** pages—like **viewing**, **adding to cart**, or **buying**—so you can run **smarter**, **more targeted ads**.

<Info>
  - Track which ads drive sales, not just clicks.
  - Find new buyers with lookalike audiences.
  - Spend smarter by targeting people who are likely to convert.
</Info>

2. Go to your **Community**, then click on the specific **Event**
3. Click **Settings** in the sidebar
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page
5. Enter your **Pixel ID** and **Conversions API Access Token**
6. Hit \*\*Save Changes \*\*whenever you are done to save

## How to Get Your Meta Pixel ID

1. Go to [Meta Ads Manager](https://adsmanager.facebook.com/adsmanager)
2. Open **Events Manager**
3. Click **Connect Data Sources** → Select **Web** → Click **Connect**
4. Name your Pixel and (optionally) enter a website
5. Copy your **Pixel ID** from the dashboard

## How to Get a Conversions API Access Token

1. In **Events Manager**, select your Pixel
2. Go to the **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to the **Conversions API** section
4. Click **Generate Access Token**
5. Copy the token (Meta will not show it again)

_This token is tied to your Pixel, not to your user account._

## How It Works?

Meta Pixels are set up in the Meta Business Console and connect to your Bubbl event.

Here’s how it works:

1. A customer visits your **event** or **organizer** page
2. The Pixel tracks the visit and sends the data to Meta
3. If they buy a ticket, that action is also reported to Meta

**Bubbl automatically tracks the following events:**
