    ### How do refunds work on Bubbl?

    As the organizer, **you are in full control** of refunds. Bubbl **will never issue a refund without your approval**, unless the event is officially canceled through the platform.

    ### Can I issue a refund to a buyer?

    Yes. You can initiate a refund directly from your **Manage Event \> Orders** tab.

    Click on the order

    Refunds are processed back to the original payment method.

    > Note: Bubbl’s platform fees are **non-refundable**, even if the ticket is refunded.
    >
    > Tip: Issuing a refund is often less expensive than disputing a chargeback. Stripe may charge dispute fees and side with the customer unless strong evidence is provided.

    #### What if I cancel my event?

    In this case please reach out to [**support@usebubbl.app**](mailto:support@usebubbl.app) within **24 hours** so we can process the event cancellation and refund all tickets.
