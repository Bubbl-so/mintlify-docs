### What Is the Event Chat?

The **Chat feature** adds a real-time conversation section to your event page.\
It lets organizers **send live messages** to everyone who bought a ticket or is following the event — perfect for driving hype and keeping your audience aligned. Guests can also send messages (if open), ask questions, and interact with you or other attendees before the event starts.

### Why Use Chat?

Chat helps you:

- **Build hype** before the event
- **Share outfit inspo**, table vibes, DJ lineups, or sneak peeks
- **Announce changes** like entry times, address tweaks, or venue updates
- **Answer guest questions** instantly (e.g., dress code, entry time, table policies)
- **Drop exclusive links** to afterparties, upsells, or post-event content
- **Foster community** among your attendees

> Chat is not for answering personal questions. Guests can message you directly via DMs for that\
> Chat is for **curated broadcasts** — to **guide the energy of your crowd**.

### How It Works

- Chat appears directly inside the event page
- You can **turn chat on or off** for each event in the **Event Settings** panel
- Set it to **“Closed Chat”** mode — where only admins can post messages

> ### Tips
>
> - Use Chat to drop **last-minute reminders** or **push table upgrades**
> - Keep it open for community-driven events, and closed for high-end or invite-only events
> - Combine with a gallery post after the event to create a full social loop (Chat ➝ Experience ➝ Memories)
> - **Every chat message you send triggers a push notification** to **every attendee** who has the Bubbl app — use this power wisely to boost urgency and engagement
