### What Is the Event Gallery?

The **Event Gallery** is a photo section on the event page where you (and sometimes your guests) can upload and view pictures from the event. It's a great way to build your brand, share the vibe, and increase guest retention.

### Who Can Upload Photos?

- If **"Closed Gallery"** is OFF:\
  Anyone who attended the event can upload photos.
- If **"Closed Gallery"** is ON:\
  Only **event admins** can upload to the gallery. This gives you full control over what gets posted.

> You can control this setting from the **Event Settings** panel under the "Gallery" section.

### Why Use Galleries?

- **Drive engagement** post-event
- **Encourage guests to share**
- **Create FOMO** for future events
- **Build community** and emotional connection with your brand

### ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success with Event Galleries

- **Build a Post-Event Gallery**\
  After your event, upload the best photos to the gallery. Guests love reliving the night â€” and it builds brand loyalty.
- **Share the Gallery Link**\
  Post your gallery on Instagram Stories, group chats, and other social platforms. This drives more people to the **Bubbl app**, increases your followers, and boosts visibility.
- **Get Featured on Explore**\
  Events with active post-event galleries are more likely to appear in the **Explore** feed â€” giving you extra organic reach.
- **Send a Post-Event Notification**\
  Use the **push notification tool** to message everyone who bought a ticket (and has the app) â€” reminding them to check the gallery.

<Tip>
  The stronger your post-event presence, the stronger your community becomes.
