### Why Use the Guest List?

The Guest List lets organizers **manually add names** for free entry, VIPs, or private invites — with full tracking.

Every addition to the list is:

- **Tracked by name** (who added them) 
- Integrated with your event’s **scanner tools**
- Ideal for handling **comps**, **special guests**, and **last-minute access**

You can also send **ticket gifts** directly through the app for a smoother entry experience.

### How to Use the Guest List

1. **Open the Bubbl app** and go to your event
2. Click on \*\*"Manage Event" \*\*then tap the **“Guest List”** section
3. Click on \*\*"Add Guest" \*\*In the entry box, type names:
   - `Joseph` (adds 1 person)
   - `Joseph +2 guests` (adds 3 people total under one name)
4. Hit **Done** — and your list will be stored, tagged with your admin name

> You can also add a list of as many people as needed, one per line
