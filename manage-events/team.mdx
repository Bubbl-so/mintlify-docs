### Key Features

- **Current Members:** View all team members with profile pictures and names

### Team Roles

#### **Admins**

Shows all **community admins** who have full access to manage both the event and the overall community. This list is fixed and managed at the community level.

**Co-hosts**

Add individuals as co-hosts to give them **full admin access for this event only** (not the entire community). Co-hosts can manage ticket tiers, view orders, message guests, and more. 

#### **Scanners**

Assign team members as **scanners** to check in guests at the door using the Bubbl app.\
This section also includes:

- Access to **Web Scanner** initialization (for admins)
- The **Android Scanner Code** for offline or external setups (for admins)

#### **Coorganizers** _(Community-to-Community Collaboration)_

Verified communities can be added as co-organizers of your event.\
Once published:

- **Push notifications** go to followers of both communities
- Both communities gain new **followers**
- Both can **view all ticket orders**
- **Payouts go only** to the event-creating community

> Co-organizers cannot manage the event unless granted additional permissions. More permission settings coming soon.

### Adding a Team Member

1. Click **“New Team Member”** at the top-right corner of the Team Management page
2. **Search** for the person you want to add by name, email, or username
3. Once found, click **“Add”** next to their profile
