### Why Use Gift Tickets?

The **Gift Ticket** feature allows you to send **free tickets** to anyone you choose — perfect for artists, collaborators, influencers, or high-value guests. Each ticket is trackable, and guests receive the same QR experience as buyers.

<Info>
  Note: Only **event admins** can send gift tickets.

### How to Send Gifts (in the App)

1. Go to your event in the **Bubbl app**
2. Tap **Manage Event \> Gift Tickets**
3. Select the **ticket tier** and **quantity**
4. Choose how to send:
   - **To User**: Type the user's **full name** as it appears on Bubbl
   - **Via Email**: Enter a name and **email address** (for non-users or manual delivery)
5. Tap **Send** — the recipient will receive their ticket immediately

### How to Send Gifts (on Web)

1. Go to **Manage Event \> Orders** from the event dashboard
2. Click **“Gift Tickets”**
3. Choose the **ticket tier**, quantity, and delivery method (user or email)
4. Confirm and send

### Tracking Gifted Tickets

Gifted tickets:

- Appear in your **Orders** tab
- Are marked as **“Gift”** instead of purchased
- Can be used for check-in just like normal tickets
- Are tracked by who sent them

<Tip>
  - Use gift tickets instead of guest list for more control and better guest experience
  - If your recipient doesn’t use Bubbl, use the email delivery option
  - Only admins can send gifts — make sure your team has the right access
  - Gifted tickets are non-refundable and bypass any payment flow. You can cancel them at any time by hitting the refund button, and the ticket will be unusable.
