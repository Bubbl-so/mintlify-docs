When you add a cohost to your event, you can choose exactly what they can **see** and **do**.\
This helps you control access across ticketing, guest lists, refunds, and more while keeping full ownership as the main organizer.

### Adding a Cohost

1. Open your **event view**.
2. Go to the **Team** tab → **Cohosts**.
3. Tap **Add Cohost**.
4. Search by name or select from your friends list.
5. Tap **Add** to invite them.

Once added, you’ll be able to manage their permissions individually.
