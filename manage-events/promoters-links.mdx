The **Promoters and Links Management** page allows event organizers to create and manage custom tracking links for their events. These links are primarily shared by promoters with clients or audiences and are used to track ticket purchases made through these links. This provides valuable insights into the performance of promotional efforts and referral programs.

### How It Works

1. **Promoters Share Their Link**\
   Each promoter or channel gets a unique tracking URL to share (via social media, DMs, email, etc.)
2. **Sales Get Tracked**\
   When someone clicks the link and buys a ticket, the sale is automatically attributed to that link.
3. **You Monitor Results**\
   Track sales and revenue per link to see which promoters or campaigns perform best.
4. **Promoter Sell**

   Each promoter has access to their view, inside the event page.

    - **Invite Users from the App**\
      Search for any user in the Bubbl app and invite them to become a promoter for your event.
    - **Sales Dashboard Access**\
      Promoters can track their own ticket sales and performance in real time.
    - **Permission-Based Access**\
      You decide what each promoter can do:
      - View their sales only
      - Add guests to the guest list _(optional)_
      - Other event-specific permissions coming soon
    - **Approval Required**\
      Promoters must **accept your invitation** before they can start promoting or viewing their link performance.
    - **Custom Messages**\
      When sending a promoter invite, you can include a **personal message** they’ll see inside the app — perfect for giving context or instructions.
