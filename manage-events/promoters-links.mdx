The **Tracking Links Management** page allows event organizers to create and manage custom tracking links for their events. These links are primarily shared by promoters with clients or audiences and are used to track ticket purchases made through these links. This provides valuable insights into the performance of promotional efforts and referral programs.

    ## How Tracking Links Work

    1. **Promoters Share the Link**:
    - Each tracking link is distributed by promoters to their audience, clients, or specific channels such as social media, email campaigns, or direct messaging.

    2. **Tracking Purchases**:
    - When a customer clicks the tracking link and completes a ticket purchase, the system attributes the purchase to that specific link.

    3. **Monitor Performance**:
    - Event organizers can review the revenue and total purchases generated from each tracking link, enabling them to evaluate the effectiveness of their promoters or promotional campaigns.
