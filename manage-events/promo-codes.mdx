**Why Use Promo Codes?**

Promo codes help you **boost ticket sales**, reward specific audiences, run **early bird or VIP discounts**, and drive urgency for special offers.\
They’re also a great tool for **promoter campaigns**, **collaborations**, and **loyalty incentives** — all while tracking performance directly in your dashboard.

You can create unlimited codes, apply them to specific ticket tiers, and see real-time sales and usage data for each one.

#### Create a Promo Code

1. Go to your Manage Event and open the **Promo Codes** tab
2. Click **“Create”** in the top-right corner
3. Fill out the details:
   - **Promo Code:** (e.g. `EARLYBIRD`, `VIPONLY`)
   - **Discount Type:** Choose between **fixed amount** (e.g. \$5 off) or **percentage** (e.g. 20% off)
   - **Amount:** Set the discount value
   - **Ticket Tier:** Apply to a specific tier or to **All Tiers**
4. Click **Create** — your promo code is now active and ready to use
5. These promo codes are applicable at **Checkout**

#### Manage Existing Promo Codes

- **View Revenue & Usage:** See who created them, when it was created, how many people used each code and how much revenue it generated
- **Show Orders:** Click “Orders” to see who used a specific code
- **Delete:** Use the trash icon to remove a code and stop further use

### Promo Code Links

You can now **share links that automatically apply a promo code** when opened. This makes it easier for guests to redeem offers with zero friction.

<Info>
  Be careful when sharing — anyone with the link can use the discount, even if they weren’t your intended audience.
