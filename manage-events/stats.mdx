### What Is the Stats Page?

The **Stats Page** gives you a complete overview of how your event is performing — from revenue and ticket scans to who’s buying and where they’re coming from.\
It’s designed to help you make smarter decisions before, during, and after your event.

### Where to Find It

- **On Web:** Go to **Event \> Manage Event \> Overview**
- **In the App:** Go to **Manage Event \> Stats**

### What You Can Track

The Stats page includes:

- **Total Revenue** – How much money your event has generated
- **Tickets Sold** – Across all tiers and types
- **Event Views** – Total number of times your event has been viewed
- **Conversion Rate** – How many people viewed vs. purchased
- **Purchases by Location** – See where your buyers are from
- **Gender Ratio** – A breakdown of buyer gender data (if available)
- **Scan Status** – How many tickets have been scanned vs. sold
- **Purchase Origin** – See whether tickets were purchased via **app** or **web**
- **Scanning by Tier** – Compare check-in rates by ticket level (e.g., VIP vs. GA)

  All data is live and updates in real time as your event progresses.
