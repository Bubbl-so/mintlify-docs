    ### Why Use Ticket Tiers?

    Ticket tiers let you **offer different access levels, pricing, and packages** for your event. Whether it’s early bird, general admission, VIP, or hidden guest-only access — you have full control over what’s sold, when, and how.

    **How to Use: Ticket Tiers**

    **Creating a Ticket Tier**

    1. Go to **Manage Tickets** and click **“New Tier”**
    2. Fill in the following:

    - **Tier Name:** What your customers will see (e.g., “Early Bird”, “VIP”, “Backstage”)
    - **Price:** Set in your event’s currency (use **\$0** for free tickets)
    - **Quantity:** Number of tickets available in this tier
    - **Description:** Optional, used to explain access or benefits (e.g., “VIP includes 2 drinks”)

    #### Advanced Options (Click “More Settings”)

    - **Min/Max Purchases:** Limit how many tickets can be bought per order
    - **Sales Start / End:** Schedule when tickets become visible and purchasable
    - **Valid Until:** Expire tickets early (e.g., guest must enter before midnight)
    - **Password Protected:** Only guests with a password can access this tier (great for private access or staff)
    - **Requires Approval:** Approve each purchase manually (useful for selective entry)
    - **App Exclusive:** Only visible to users in the **Bubbl app**, not on web (ideal for community drops)
    - **Hide Tier:** Hide from customer view until you’re ready to go live
    - **Mark as Sold Out:** Manually mark a tier as sold out (even if there’s quantity left)
    - **Tap to Pay Settings (USA only):**
      - **Sell Online:** Allow the tier to be sold on both app and web
      - **Sell at the Door:** Allow the tier to be sold in-person using Tap to Pay

      <Info>
        If “Sell Online” is off, the ticket will only be visible at the door (not in advance)
      </Info>

    #### Linked Tiers

    Use **Linked Tiers** to automate availability:

    - When one tier sells out, another becomes available (e.g., Early Bird ➝ General Admission)

    ### Custom Questions & Terms

    Inside **Manage Tickets**, you can add:

    - **Text Box Questions** (e.g., guest name, Instagram handle)
    - **Checkboxes** for custom Terms & Conditions (e.g., “I agree to the no-refund policy”)

      <Info>
        These show up before checkout and responses are saved in each order.
      </Info>

    ### Add Table Maps or Visuals

    Upload a **Table Map** or venue image that appears to customers while selecting tickets.\
    Use this for:

    - Bottle service layouts
    - Seating charts
    - Area zones or entry instructions

    > ### Tips for Tickets:
    >
    > - Set **“Valid Until”** if you want to reward early arrival (e.g., Ladies Free Before 11 PM)
    > - Use \*\*Password Protection \*\*for influencer drops or early access
    > - Use **Requires Approval** for exclusive entry events or events with dress code filtering
    > - Add **Linked tiers** to automate sales flow (Early Bird ➝ GA ➝ VIP)
  </Tab>

    ### Why Use Tables?

    Tables are for **bottle service or VIP reservations** and usually require manual approval. Bubbl lets you treat tables like premium ticket tiers — but with stricter controls.

    ### How to Use: Table Tiers

    - Go to **Manage Tickets \> Tables**

    Click **New Tier** and configure just like a ticket, with some key differences:

    - **Requires Approval** is **always enabled** for tables
    - Use the **description** field to list inclusions (e.g., “Includes 2 bottles \+ 5 guests”)
    - Tables can have **custom pricing**, availability windows, and names (e.g., “Main Stage Booth”)

    > ### Tips for Tables
    >
    > - Include **bottle minimums** or guest limits in your tier name or description
    > - Use **table maps** to show layout and drive higher conversion
    > - Track approvals easily from the **Orders tab**, and contact guests if more info is needed
    >
    > How Tables Are Typically Used: Tables offer a lot of flexibility in how you set them up.
    >
    > Most organizers use one of these two strategies:
    >
    > - **Full Payment Upfront:**\
    >   Set the table price (e.g., **\$1000**) and include **1 ticket** in the tier. Then, manually **send 9 gift tickets** to complete the 10-person table. This gives you full control over who gets access.
    > - **Reservation Fee Model:**\
    >   Some organizers charge just a **deposit or reservation fee** (usually around **10% of the total**) to secure the table. The remaining amount is collected at the venue.
